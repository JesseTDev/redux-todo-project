<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

- React
- Typescript
- Redux
- Styled-components
- MUI

<h3>Notes</h3>

- React was chosen because I aim to become a junior react developer and for its capablities and ui development.
- First time using typescript. Utilised custom types and default ts compiler.
- For the CSS, it is a mixture of styled-components and MUI. It was outside the scope of this project to configure CRA / styled-components / MUI to work together.
- Created some custom components and some from MUI to get used to both approaches to ui development.
