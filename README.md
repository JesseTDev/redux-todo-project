<h3>Project Overview:</h3>

This is a simple todo application that allows the users to effectively manage their tasks. The application provides a range of features to enhance productivity and organisation. The users can add default todo's to get an overview of the applications functionality and can create their own todos that includes a title, description and urgency. The users can utilise various filters to retrieve specific tasks using filter by date, title text, and the urgency of the todo. Additionally, the users can personalise their experience by creating their own username and can also remove their todos from the application.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

- React
- Typescript
- Redux
- Styled-components
- MUI

<h3>Notes</h3>

- React was chosen because I aim to become a junior react developer and for its capabilities and ui development.
- First time using typescript. Utilised custom types and default ts compiler.
- For the CSS, it is a mixture of styled-components and MUI. It was outside the scope of this project to configure CRA / styled-components / MUI to work together.
- Created some custom components and some from MUI to get used to both approaches to ui development.
